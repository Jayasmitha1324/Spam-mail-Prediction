# Spam-mail-Prediction
This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify email messages as either spam or ham (not spam). A labeled dataset of emails is used for training, where each message is cleaned and converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. A Logistic Regression classifier is applied to the processed data using scikit-learn, achieving over 96% accuracy on both training and test datasets. The project demonstrates essential concepts in natural language processing (NLP), text feature extraction, and binary classification using Python-based machine learning tools.
